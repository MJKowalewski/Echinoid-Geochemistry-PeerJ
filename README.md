Supplementary materials for Gorzelak et al. 2024. Geochemical signatures and nanomechanical properties of echinoid tests from nearshore habitats of Florida: Environmental and physiological controls on echinoid biomineralization. Revised version submitted to PeerJ 10/2024

The repository containes Appendices 1-6 for paper by Gorzelak et al. on echinoid geochemistry. The file will be updated after the acceptance of the manuscript.

The following files are included:

Appendix1 revised.csv: Bulk geochemistry data (.csv format)
Appendix2 revised.csv: Nano-scale analysis data (.csv format)
Appendix3 revised.R: R script for generating figures (Figs 1-8) and tables (Tables 1-4) (R script)
Appendix4 revised.R: R script with custom functions sourced by the main R script (Appendix 3) (R Script)
Appendix5 revised.csv: coastline coordinates of Florida for generating Figure 1 (from NOAA: https://gnome.orr.noaa.gov/goods/tools/GSHHS/coast_subset) (.csv format)
Appendix6 revised.csv: Raw geochemical data prior to Ca-normalization (not used in any analyses) (.csv format)
Appendix7 revised.xlsx: SEM images shoing location of sampling points for Nano-scale data (.xlsx format)
